PRIMERS (and tag) still in the sequences, need to remove. 
Has to be done with e.g. cutadapt, where there is -e option to allow mismatches.
I have no workflow for this.

Important is to note that sequences may be also 3'-5' oriented.
Check if cutadapt takes this inot account, or we first need to reorient all reads to 5'-3' based on primers.
