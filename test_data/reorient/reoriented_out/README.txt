*.reoriented.fastq files here represent sequences that have been reoriented based on PCR primers.
Forward primer(s) [has to be 5'-3']: ACCTGCTAGGCTAGATGC
Reverse primer(s) [has to be 3'-5']: GGGATCCATCGATTTAAC
[If primers were not specified in orientations noted above, please run this step again].

Output R1 and R2 reads have been synchronized for merging paired-end data. 
(R1 reads are 5'-3' oriented and R2 reads 3'-5' oriented (for merging paired-end data)).

If data was compressed (gz or zip), then it was uncompressed by keeping the original compressed file.
If you do not need to use the uncompressed data further, you may delete these duplicates to save disk space.

Note that, when applicable, then ':' symbols in the sequence headers (before space or tab) are changed to '_'.
This does not affect merging paired-end reads using PipeCraft implemented software.

NOTE RUNNING THE PROCESS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE SAME DIRECTORY WILL OVERWRITE ALL THE OUTPUTS!
